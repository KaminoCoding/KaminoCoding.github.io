		<div><p>Minecraft modding is something that I personally enjoy doing. It helps me to learn Java while providing something for people to use. The project showcased is one where I develop the mod for anyone in the community that has a request. It is a pet project for me at the moment so I work on it when I get the chance but school and work come first since I'm not making money on it.</p></div>

		<div><p>I update one other mod called Invincible Hamster. This is a mod that I picked up from the developer Ivorius after he decided to stop work on it. It is a particularly nice mod that still has a lot of support. It is however a big pain to work on and update because of the things is uses.</p></div>

		<div><p>I also have 2 other mods that I kinda work on in passing but don't take as seriously as CommuMod. Friend Namer is one that I whipped up in a day because I was bored. It gives the user the ability to add nicknames for their friends on the client side and not need a server plugin. I also started work on a mod called Better Foods. The idea was for it to be a true to life food creation mod with all sorts of cooking utilities. The bigges setback on that project was the lack of my ability to model items. I now know how to model but implementing them right is like my ability to use SVGs in a website. It doesn't exist. So for now those have just sat in my Github account waiting to be worked on.</p></div>
