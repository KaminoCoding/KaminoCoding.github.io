	<h3>Favorite Albums</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>F.E.A.R.</dt>
		<dd>This album is one of my favorite albums from Papa Roach. It was released in mid spring of 2015 and is an all around great album.</dd>
		<dt>Infest</dt>
		<dd>Infest is an older album released in 2000. I particularly like this album because it is a really nice album without much synthetic distortions except for the guitar.</dd>
		<dt>The Paramour Sessions</dt>
		<dd>This is a really powerful rock album and is super fun to listen too.</dd>
